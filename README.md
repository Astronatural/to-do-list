# The Big TO-DO List

    Do you have things to do?  Sure you do!  Well this app is just the thing to help\
     keep your list of tasks organized and up to date.



## Description


    This app is a great place to store a list of things you need to do, mark which\
     tasks you've completed and delete them once you've basked in the satisfaction of accomplishment long enough.



## Usage


    There are 4 main features of the Big TO-DO List:

    1) The "Enter Task" field and associated "Submit Chore" button.
    2) The "Task Table" where all your chores are listed.
    3) The "Complete?" button which marks a task as completed when pressed.
        -A completed task is marked with a green checkmark and the listed task text\
         is crossed out when it is marked as complete\

    4) The "Delete Task" button, in eraser pink, clicking this button will delete\
     the task in the associated row on the task table.
